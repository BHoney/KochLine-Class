##KochLine Class
*--Last Updated 19 Nov 2014--*
This class contains a series of java code based scripts used to write and develop a number of images using the Koch Snowflake Fractal. To use, simply modify the code within to produce new lines and watch the program draw the lines.

This is an extended exercise in practicing recurison and UI. This is to be submitted to College of Charleston's CSCI221 Progamming II course.

Modification, such as allowing the user to dictate the lines, may occur.
